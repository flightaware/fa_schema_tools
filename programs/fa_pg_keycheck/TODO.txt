If we don't find a primary key or a unique non-null key, before creating one,
check to see if any fields have a default value that looks something like

    not null default nextval('accounts_billing_id_seq'::regclass)

...then that's a candidate for just having an index added rather than an
entire new field.  Recognize and do that.
